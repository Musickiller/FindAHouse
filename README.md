I learn JS and HTML5 Canvas. I've finished a tutorial where I built a PingPong game. And do you know what I disliked most there? The code inside that game could only be used by this game or very similar games.

So what I want to do here is to make a (more or less) simple renderer wich would take predifined objects and display them on the screen.

I understand that there might be a lot of stuff like that, but I am slso learning JS in the process, so I want to do this more or less on my own.
